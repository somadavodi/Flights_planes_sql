## Airlines

### This is a simple postgresql practice. 

**Step 1:** 
You should first create three tables named: airlines, planes and sold_seats and their corresponding columns as follow: 
1. airlines
   - airline_id *(primary key)*
   - plane_id
 
2. planes
   - plane_id *(primary key)*
   - number_of_seats
 
3. sold_seats 
   - airline_id
   - seat_num

**Step 2:** 
Information (entities) about each table is provided where we can use **INSERT INTO** syntax to add rows. 

**Task:** 
  To find number of seats that are not sold for each airline.
